# BrainF-ckInterpreter *WIP*
My attempt at writing an interpreter for BrainF*ck  
## Using this tool  
- If you want to use this tool you will have to compile it yourself rn (make file is included)  
  - Compiles with the command `make`  
- To use this tool as a command line interpreter just run the executable `bf` and you should ge the prompt `brainf*ck> `  
- To run a file just run `bf {file path}`
